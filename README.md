# Cinema Sales Analysis


## Introduction

This project involves working with a large dataset containing approximately 4.5 thousand customer records and over 35 rows of cinema industry data. The goal is to derive meaningful insights about customers and sales for the company.

The project begins by cleaning, validating, and normalizing the data using Python. Once the data is prepared, it is imported into Power BI to create data models and utilize DAX for visualization.


## Usage

1. **Data Cleaning with Python:**
   - Navigate to the `data` directory.
   - Run the Jupyter Notebook file `data_cleaning.ipynb` to perform data cleaning, validation, and normalization.

2. **Visualization with Power BI:**
   - Open the Power BI file `Cinema Sales Analysis.pbix` using Power BI Desktop.
   - Explore the pre-built data models and visualizations to gain insights into customer behavior and sales trends.
